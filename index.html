          </h2>
          <p id="about-para">
              Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. 
              His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, 
              followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of 
              commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most 
              influential people in the world,and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid 
              actor.At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. 
              He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). 
              In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award 
              for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug 
              charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the 
              wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his 
              sobriety since 2003.
